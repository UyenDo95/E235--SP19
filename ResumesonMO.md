## Lesson Abstact
>A résumé, often referred to as a CV (curriculum vitae), is a summary of a person’s background and experience, including work experience, education, and even volunteer work, and its most common use is to send to potential employers when searching for a new career opportunity. In fact, though taking on a much different form than that of what you’d expect a résumé to look like today, Leonardo Da Vinci even did this himself, and he is often given credit as the first person to create a resume.
