Reflection on Composing Instruction Sets
----------------
When I started to do the instruction sets, I did think a lot of formats of how to write the good guideline so that audience could easily follow my guideline. However, it seemed like not to be easy at all, because I did not know how to organize and what to put in my instruction. Then I chose to express my tutorial on Power Point, which can help me make my pictures and my words in an nice order. When I wrote my instruction, I imagined myself as an audience, then I put every single picture as detailed as possible. The thing I realized after I was done is that I still failed in using tone and using words correctly in my insruction. I think I have to improve more about that in the next couple of projects.

Audience Sense
----------
As I said above, when I wrote my guideline, I acted like an audience. As an audience, I required the guideline had to have the detailed pictures. Because my English is not good, sometimes I cannot understand English well or cannot write a clear sentences. Therefore, I hope detailed pictures will hope me and my audience follow easily my guideline when my English make them confused. About the text, I prefer to use the words as simple as possible, so that everybody can understand even non native speaker. However, I think I did not clarify well enough for audience to understand my purpose in some places of my tutorial because I just use the repeated words.

Platforms
--------
Before writing the instruction, I did research a lot about the platforms. At the beginning, I wanted to make the infographic with the nice organized images and text. However, it was quite hard for me to put everything in one page of infographic. Then, I think about Power Point, which helps me organize pictures and words in many slides with same frames. I did see a student in class using Word to write his instruction. His Word has small gridline. He put his pictures in the horizontal line then he put his text under the pictures. It seems to be simple, but to me it is hard to organize like he did and it is very cool. I think I may try that way in my next project if I have a chance.

Conclusion
--------
All in all, I think this week I had a chance to do a realistic guideline using a real platform. I learn to be act as an audience to see wht should I put on my text for reader. When I did the activities in class, I receive some feedback from my friends, which made me have more insight to improve the way I write my guideline. One more thing I learned from this week was how to use Markdown and use markdown to organize my repository.
