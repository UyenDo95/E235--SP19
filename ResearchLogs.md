Introduce Myself
---------------

My name is Uyen Do, a Vietnamese girl. I have been in America for over two years. I like reading books and traveling around the world. If I can go outside, I will visit Paris first because of its beauty and its romantic. 
My major is Mechanical Engineering. I am a big fan of creating things and I have an extreme hunger for knowing how things work and operate. Mechanical Engineering can help me follow that passion and give me tools to build up my career.

Technical Writing
----------------

Before joining this class, I assumed that techincal writing is an academic writing which is organized, informative and in order such as resumes, CVs, and science reports. However, after I read the readings of this week and did some researches, my mind changes a little bit. In my opinion, techincal writing has a set of rules and organized as certain topics. For example, it could be the program guidline, which shows clearly step by step how to code a program in order for the audience to see and easily to follow the instuction. Like wise, the writing tone also depends on the types of audience, which helps the writers form the way to write their papers.

GitHub
---------------

This is the first time I used GitHub, which gives me some "wow" moments when first using it.
To access the GitHub, I need to create an account with user names and password. After reading the "Hello World" tutorial, I find it not to difficult to have an account on Github. Then, I had to follow the intruction to create my first repository with multiple complicated steps. 
I noticed that "Hello - World" tutorial is very informative, which not only shows the steps by words, but also includes images and motion pictures. I think images and pictures gave me a big hand in finishing my repository. Because I am not native American, sometimes I find hard to undersand the language and picture can help me imagine how things work. Therefore, I think to have a good tutorial, I should have clear steps with probably words and illustration pictures, so audience can read and easily follow my steps.
